# Research
### Research at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab & UC Berkeley
* **Manufacturing and Characterizing Ultra-thin LLZO Ceramic Electrolytes**
    - Manufactured ultra-thin (<100Î¼m) LLZO ceramic electrolytes and optimized the grain size and porositybyadjusting the composition and sintering conditions, such as temperature, time, and ramp rate.
    - Characterized the surface morphology of LLZO ceramic electrolytes through SEMimaging and EBSDanalysis.
    - Measured local ionic conductivities using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and microelectrodestostudy how crystal orientations affect ionic conductivities.
    - Conducted FIB lift-out and ion-milling for TEM sample preparation.
* **Mechanical Modeling and Characterization of Composite Cathodes of NCM/LPS Solid-State Batteries**
    - ***Publication:*** Shi, Tan & Zhang, Yaqian & Tu, Qingsong & Wang, Yuhao & Scott, M. &Ceder, Gerbrand. (2020).Characterization of mechanical degradation in an all-solid-state battery cathode. Journal of Materials ChemistryA.
    - Performed FIB-SEM tomography to characterize morphology changes in the composite cathode (NCM/LPS)dueto charging cycles and quantified the increasing void volume through cycles.
